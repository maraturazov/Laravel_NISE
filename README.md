# How to Install
* Set up .env (as a copy of .env.example) with your local environment details, including database logins that are included in the Scotch Box docs
* run `php artisan key:generate`
* run `composer install`
* run `npm install`

Once everything is up and running, pull requests can be made to the main repo (on a feature branch) and deployed to live once reviewed.
